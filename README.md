# Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite soolveTheX fronts

This has been my first ever Vue project 💪🏾

This was part of a company challenge, to develop a Vue front-end that connects to the back-end:
https://github.com/Cudi7/solveTheX_backend (this was the other part, with Node & Typescript)

As a React Developer, I have found several similarities with React environment, even though I barely read or watch any resource, just the necessary (Having in count my limited time to do so) I found vue easier to begin than it was React.

I don't know yet how to execute a proper well structured code nor how to structure components or pass props, I only dived down a tiny portion of what I assume vue is capable of.

Overall, it has been a good practice to do something with a brand new technology.
